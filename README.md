- Cards flip on click, displaying a hidden fruit icon.
- Matching pairs remain face-up; unmatched pairs flip back after a delay.
- Shuffle functionality to randomize card placement each game.
- Overlay message congratulating players after finding all pairs.
- Restart button to reset and shuffle the game board.
